With our climate worsening by the second, it is important we start to focus upon the various details which contribute to those problems. 
One of those conflicts revolves around the produce that consumers purchase at stores, primarily grocery stores. 
Products all around the world are delivered to the places where one goes to purchase food. 
Although it may be easy to bring the food to our homes, the procedure for transferring those items from other places is highly complex and dreadful at times. 
For example, certain items consume unnecessary high volumes of water, working conditions of the people processing the items are gruesome and items located faraway result in transportation vehicles releasing great amounts of pollution. 
Taking into consideration these factors, we decided to create an app which would assess the food located at grocery stores and showcase a grade depending on how it was delivered
